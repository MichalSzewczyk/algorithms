    /**
     * Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but once planted,
     * it will detonate after exactly 3 seconds. Once a bomb detonates,
     * it's destroyed â€” along with anything in its four neighboring cells.
     * This means that if a bomb detonates in cell (i, j), any valid cells (i +/- 1, j) and (i, j +/- 1) are cleared. If there is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the neighboring bomb is destroyed without detonating, so there's no chain reaction.
     *
     * Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid. Here's what he does:
     *
     * Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells, the initial state.
     * 1. After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
     * 2. After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs, thus filling the whole grid with bombs. No bombs detonate at this point.
     * 3. After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will detonate. Here, Bomberman stands back and observes.
     * 4. Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.
