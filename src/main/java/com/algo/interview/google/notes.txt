Interview 1
1. Given the list of edges of directed graph, count the number of nodes that are connected in both directions (A -> B and B -> A)
2. Given the list of vectors sorted, return the list of elements that appear in at least k vectors
Interview 2
3. Given the graph where each node has at most 3 neighbours. Return the list of nodes that can be taken as the roots to form the binary tree, i.e.
        1
       / \
      2   3
         / \
        4   5
if the 4 is selected as root, then the graph is as below:
        4
        |
        3
       / \
      1   5
      |
      2
4. Similarly as in 3. return the list of nodes, that taken as root will form the binary tree.
In addition to that, each node has color, either white or black.
Make sure that each node at the graph has children of different color than it is, i.e.
          4 (black)
          |
          3 (white)
         / \
(black) 1   5 (black)
        |
        2 (white)
